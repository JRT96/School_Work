<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>Posted by BGB, November 15, 2017</p>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)
     into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching. 
    </p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <span id="bold">Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</span>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p>Location:<br>Bakers Corner, Sekkon, MA</p>  
<p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
