    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>

    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. 
        In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to 
        the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
        In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching. </p>

        <p>Next month, we will be serving<span id="Dill"> Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</span>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, 
            contact us before November 30</p>

            <p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
